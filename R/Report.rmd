## Summary
This project investigates the relationship between household composition changes. Specifically, it is investagting the changes in the number of married and unmarried households—and county-level social 
vulnerability in the U.S. using k-means clustering and t-SNE for visualization. The household data is processed to extract features such as slope,
acceleration, and curve fit quality from time series data spanning 2009–2023. 

## Non-Technical
I think that the graphs themeselves are lacking the appropriate labels and lack an context that could help the reader better understand the goals. 
On that note, I think that the format of the writing could be better organized - perhaps explain why the question is important and an explanation into the
actual dataset would help elucidate some of the confusions I intially had with this project. As a personal comment, I would say that the 
abrupt transitions between steps (e.g., from clustering to model prediction) make it hard to follow the logic of the analysis.
